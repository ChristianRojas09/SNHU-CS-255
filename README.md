### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The projects client, DriverPass, was a small driving school that wanted to take advantage of the lack of online driving courses. The system to be designed was a web application that shared similiarities with other learning management systems like D2L, or blackboard. The system was to be a place that students could purchase course packages, schedule lessons, view course content and take practice tests in preparation for their drivers license exam.

### What did you do particularly well?

I felt that as I have gone through this course, my diagramming has improved a lot. I better understand the different purposes that different diagrams server, and how each one shows a different perspective of the system and how it should operate.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would like to revise my UML use case diagram's writing section. Taking the feedback I recieved on technical terminology, I would like to give the audience more consideration and use terminology that is easier to digest.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

It is important to consider the user's needs because after all, they are the ones who will be using the system regularly. Taking user needs into consideration, it is important to emulate ways they may interact with each part of a system. For example, the layout of the dashboard is important because after loggin in, this is what the user will be greeted with. Having an organized dashboard that provides information without overwhelming the user will provide a pleasant experience - which is more likely to keep the user engaged.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach software design by taking the general idea of a systems function and breaking it down into small pieces. Each piece being a function that will allow the system to achieve its purpose. In the future, I will utilize diagramming much more as I realize how valuable of a tool it can be during the design and analysis stage.
